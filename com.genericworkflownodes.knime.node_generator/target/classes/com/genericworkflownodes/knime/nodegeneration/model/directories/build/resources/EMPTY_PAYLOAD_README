This fragment does not hold any binaries but was created to allow the manual
addition of binaries. You should link binaries to the sub-directory bin/, e.g.,

plug-in-directory/
    META-INF/
        MANIFEST.MF
    payload/
        README
        bin/
            YOUR_EXECUTABLE

 Using this mechanism the plug-in should find the correct binary for your 
 platform.
 
!!!!! NOTE: The binaries you add manually *need* to match the version expected
!!!!!       by the plug-in.
