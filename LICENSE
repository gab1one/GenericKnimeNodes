GenericKnimeNodes is licensed under the 

 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3
 with an exception of the com.genericworkflownodes.knime.gpl3nodes bundle
 which uses more than the standard API of the KNIME source code and is therefore GPL3 instead of LGPL3.

(see LGPL.LICENSE and GPL.LICENSE).

## Dependencies:


GenericKnimeNodes depends upon

- KNIME plugin functionality which is considered to be GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3-compatible
  due to its API usage exception:
  "Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,
  NodeDialog, and NodeView) and that only interoperate with KNIME through
  standard APIs ("Nodes"):
  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be
  covered works.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the License,
  the License does not apply to Nodes, you are not required to license Nodes
  under the License, and you are granted a license to prepare and propagate
  Nodes, in each case even if such Nodes are propagated with or for
  interoperation with KNIME.  The owner of a Node may freely choose the
  license terms applicable to such Node, including when such Node is
  propagated with or for interoperation with KNIME."
- SwingX which is licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V2
- Netbeans Outline library which is in its used version
  dual-licensed under CDDL 1.0 and GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V2-only with classpath exception
  (see https://netbeans.org/cddl-gplv2.html). It is assumed that it is used here in compliance with the classpath exception.
  @TODO: If we upgrade, the newest version is Apache-2 licensed (although we THINK due to the classpath exception,
  it is fine in its current state)
- BeanShell which is also licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3
