## Dependencies:


GenericKnimeNodes depends upon

- KNIME plugin functionality which is considered to be GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3-compatible
  (see http://knime.org/downloads/license) 
@TODO jpfeuffer: Is this really true? Most of KNIME is GPLv3 (no lesser)
- SwingX which is also licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V2
- Netbeans Outline library which is in its used version
  dual-licensed under CDDL 1.0 and GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V2-only with classpath exception
  (see https://netbeans.org/cddl-gplv2.html) 
@TODO jpfeuffer: If we upgrade, the newest version is Apache-2 licensed (although I THINK due to the classpath exception,
  it is fine in its current state)
- BeanShell which is also licensed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3
- for our Apache Xerces binary dependecies please notice the Apache License 2.0 (APACHE.LICENSE)
