        <intro>
        	When dealing with port objects like they are used with Generic KNIME Nodes, problems arise when the data needs to be sent to
        	a cluster or when the different KNIME loop constructs need to be used. In order to circumvent those problems this node can
        	turn port objects containing files into tables. If the port object is a prefix port object, containing multiple files that
        	share a prefix, all those files are put into a single row in the table. If, on the other hand, the port object simply contains
        	a collection of files, those files are distributed over multiple rows, allowing the cluster extension to split the table and loop
        	nodes to loop over the files. The File Cells to Port node can be used to turn a table created by this node back into a port object.
