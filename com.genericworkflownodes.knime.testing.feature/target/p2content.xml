        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;                       Version 3, 29 June 2007&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates&#xA;the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public&#xA;License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.&#xA;&#xA;  0. Additional Definitions.&#xA;&#xA;  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU&#xA;General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,&#xA;other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&#xA;&#xA;  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided&#xA;by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.&#xA;Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode&#xA;of using an interface provided by the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an&#xA;Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library&#xA;with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked&#xA;Version&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xA;Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code&#xA;for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are&#xA;based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#xA;object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data&#xA;and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the&#xA;Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#xA;&#xA;  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License&#xA;without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#xA;&#xA;  2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#xA;&#xA;  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a&#xA;facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application&#xA;that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified&#xA;version:&#xA;&#xA;   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to&#xA;   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the&#xA;   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#xA;&#xA;   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of&#xA;   this License applicable to that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#xA;&#xA;  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from&#xA;a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object&#xA;code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated&#xA;material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure&#xA;layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates&#xA;(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#xA;&#xA;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the&#xA;   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;   covered by this License.&#xA;&#xA;   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xA;   document.&#xA;&#xA;  4. Combined Works.&#xA;&#xA;  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,&#xA;taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the&#xA;portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of&#xA;the following:&#xA;&#xA;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that&#xA;   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;   covered by this License.&#xA;&#xA;   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#xA;   document.&#xA;&#xA;   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during&#xA;   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among&#xA;   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the&#xA;   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#xA;&#xA;   d) Do one of the following:&#xA;&#xA;       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this&#xA;       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form&#xA;       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to&#xA;       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of&#xA;       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the&#xA;       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying&#xA;       Corresponding Source.&#xA;&#xA;       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time&#xA;       a copy of the Library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version&#xA;       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked&#xA;       Version.&#xA;&#xA;   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise&#xA;   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the&#xA;   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is&#xA;   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the&#xA;   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the&#xA;   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If&#xA;   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany&#xA;   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application&#xA;   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation&#xA;   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL&#xA;   for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#xA;&#xA;  5. Combined Libraries.&#xA;&#xA;  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side by side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this&#xA;License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your&#xA;choice, if you do both of the following:&#xA;&#xA;   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based&#xA;   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,&#xA;   conveyed under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it&#xA;   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the&#xA;   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xA;of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new&#xA;versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may&#xA;differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version&#xA;of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;&#xA;applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that published version or of any later version&#xA;published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you&#xA;received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide&#xA;whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall&#xA;apply, that proxy&apos;s public statement of acceptance of any version is&#xA;permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the&#xA;Library.
